science: generalizable and replicable ()

1. define a research question
Write down a conceptual framework/hypothesis
check literature
develop an empirical approach

2. think about the data available and the measurement error

total error = row error + column error + cell error

row error: rows omitted,                        duplicated 

        taxis/ people who don't take taxi    |  one ssn for thousands of jobs in CA and TX damn foreigners

- interpretation

cell error
- content error (problems in the measurement process, transcription error, data processing error)
- specification error (error in data capture fro specific units)
- missing data (the measurement process, transcription error, data processing error)
